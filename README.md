# git-status
If you're like me, you keep your git repositories all in one folder. But when working on multiple repositories, it can become hard to remember where you left off in each one. By navigating to said folder, invoking this command will list all of your repos in the folder, and their status. **This program does not check for unpushed commits.**

## Installation
```
brew install mattraimondi/formulae/git-status
```
